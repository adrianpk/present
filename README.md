Inside this repository, you'll find a collection of slides focused on Go concurrency. These slides cover various aspects of concurrent programming in Go, starting from the basics such as goroutines and channels, and progressing to more advanced topics.


## Presentation

To launch the slides follow these simple steps:

1. Copy and paste the following command into your terminal:

```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adrianpk/present/main/launch.sh')"
```

2. While the script is deemed safe, caution is always advisable, If you prefer the manual route, here's Plan B:

$ git clone git@github.com:adrianpk/present.git slides

$ cd slides
